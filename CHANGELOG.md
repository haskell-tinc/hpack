## next
  - Add `--numeric-version`
  - Add support for `signatures`
  - `extra-doc-files` requires setting `cabal-version` to at least
    1.18; this is now done properly.
  - Accept bool for `condition` (see #230)
  - Allow `github` to be an object, which newly permits setting the branch
    and the homepage anchor, as well as the subdirectory.

    This changes the generated homepage of any project using `github`
    with a subdirectory: previously it pointed to the repository's
    root, but now it points into the subdirectory.
